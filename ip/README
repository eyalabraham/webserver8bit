I wrote this IP stack after trying out the LwIP stack for my project. LwIP is hosted on SAVANNAH:
https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/ or http://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_0_x/index.html.
LwIP was not light weight enough for my needs, and the documentation, IMHO,
was less than adequate for debugging issues. While functions and data structures
were nicely documented, the examples and wiki were often out dated.
LwIP 2.0.2 was too convoluted for my needs to support a simple ethernet interface
in a DOS environment, and within my home-brew multi-tasking executive https://github.com/eyalabraham/robotics/tree/master/smte
The stack I decided to code myself borrows several implementation ideas from LwIP, while heavily adapting it
to the modest requirements of my projects.

The structure of the code modules follows the OSI model, with as much flexibility as I thought
would be useful. The framework can be extended for features such as more than one ethernet interface,
or varying amounts of resources dedicated to UDP or TCP connections, an ARP table size, etc.

Each module matches a layer in the OSI model, and 'plugs into' a common 'stack' module.
The 'stack' module implements only IPv4, and supplies all the data structures and utilities 
that are used to run the stack: such as timers, setup/init code, network/host byte order conversions and so on.
The stack module follows the LwIP model of call-backs. This model fit my needs for running the stack
in a single threaded environment with no OS. This stack will be able to run in my FlashLite NEC v25
8bit SBC DOS or my home-brew multi-task executive (https://sites.google.com/site/eyalabraham/robotics#software).
In both cases the stack will be running as an isolated single thread.

 1. ENC28J60 driver
-----------------------------------------
The driver structure borrows a lot from the LwIP driver skeleton provided with the LwIP source code.
This is simply because I had the driver written for LwIP and chose to reuse the code more or less as is.
The driver module contains two stack interface functions: link_output() and link_input().
link_input() is called periodically by the network interface function interface_input(). The function checks
the network device for the waiting packets and reads them into a buffer.
link_output() is a function that will be called by the stack when data packets need to be transmitted.
link_output() is linked to the stack through the net_interface_t 'linkoutput' member,
and is intended to send data as-is. When data packets need to be sent and require address resolution (adding
source and destination MAC addresses) the function linked to the 'output' member should be used; this function
runs through address resolution first and then calls link_output() through 'linkoutput' member. This mode of
operation is very much identical to LwIP.
The link_state() function will test the link condition and return 'up' (1) or 'down' (0) condition. This function should
also be called repeatedly from within the same loop as interface_input(), and the code should take action if link
state has changed from the last poll.

 2. Network interface (netif)
-----------------------------------------
The network interface module is a common code module for any driver.
There is a one-to-one relationship between driver and network interface because the driver
functions for input and output will be accessed through a common net_interface_t structure.
The network interface module (netif.c) exposes two functions: interface_init() and interface_input().
The interface_init() function is used to initialize the interface. In my implementation it calls the driver
function enc28j60Init() for the chip initialization.
The interface_input() function will be used to poll for input packets. It will either return immediately if no
packets are waiting to be read from the interface HW, or read a waiting packet and forward it up the stack.
The function interface_input() should be called repeatedly in the main program inside an infinite loop so that
it can periodically poll the interface. There is no support for an interrupt driven setup.

 3. ARP
-----------------------------------------
The ARP module provides two basic functions: it provides address resolution using ARP requests logged in an internal ARP table,
and it filters ARP replies and IPv4 inputs for processing.
The ARP module includes a 'Gratuitous ARP' function that can be called at the users discretion.
When packet output is required the arp_output() function is called from the ipv4 module. The function will
attept to resolve the destination IP address using the ARP table. If ARP table resolution fails, the ARP module
will issue an ARP request.

 4. IPv4 Network layer
-----------------------------------------
The ipv4 module is a rather simple implementation with two main functions: on packet input the module invokes the
appropriate handler for ICMP, UDP or TCP. On packet output the module consults a routing table and selects the appropriate
interface for sending it, then invokes the arp_output().
The module also includes an ICMP input handler. This handler is located here instead of in the ICMP module simply
because the stack should always be able to respond to ping requests. The ICMP module implements optional outgoing PING
functionality describe in #5.

 5. Transport layer ICMP UDP and TCP
-----------------------------------------
  ICMP Ping
    The ICMP module implements an ICMP outgoing Ping request. The usage is demonstrated in the ethtest.c program.
    This functionality is implemented as a separate module to allow the user a choice f implementation.
    As noted in #4, responses to incoming Pings are handled in the ipv4.c module and are 'built in' to the stack.
    
  UDP
    The UDP module implementation follows a minimal implementation of the LwIP API calls that roughly matches
    the function calls in a typical socket interface; specifically call to udp_new() (create a 'socket'), udp_close(),
    udp_bind(), udp_sendto and udp_recv().
    The receiver function does not block (can't do that here), is only registers a callback that will be invoked is a
    datagram arrives and matches the IP/port binding.
    The modules provide another call for initializing UDP PCBs, which are Protocol Control Block like LwIP, and for
    linking in the UDP input handler with the ipv4 module packet input handling function.
    
  TCP
    @@ to be implemented

 6. Common stack components
-----------------------------------------
The IPv4 stack functions are typically separated according to the layer they act in. The ASCII diagram has the
module names listed in the appropriate stack locations.
The stack has several utility functions that are common to all or most layers such as timers, buffer allocation, etc.,
which are all located in the ip4stack.c module.

Buffer allocation
    I chose to use a very simple, probably also wasteful, buffer allocation schema.
    The allocation is done from a statically provisioned (optionally a dynamic allocation) set of
    buffers of a know fixed size. I chose 1536 bytes per buffer because it aligns with the CPU addressing,
    and is large enough for a single Ethernet packet. This way there is no chaining of smaller buffers and processing is simpler.
    There is one set of buffers for transmit and receive, and the count can be set in options.h header file.
    Allocation is done from the pool of buffers with calls to allocatePbuf() and freePbuf() ;-)
    The options account for a receive buffer count of 1 because the ENC28J60 interface has up to 8K byte of possible memory
    buffering, out of which I provisioned 5K byte for receive frames and 3K byte (2 x frame sizes) for transmit buffer.

To-Dos
-----------------------------------------
1.  [done] Implement Gratuitous ARP
2.  Error handling
    - remove all assert() and replace with error handling code
    - before forwarding packet to IP layer, check that the dest. IP matches our IP
      if not there is a possible mis-configured ARP table somewhere
3.  Document
    - ARP
    - Timers and system time
4.  Add functions to inerface_ to set IP addr, Gateway and Subnet Mask
5.  [done] Code ICMP response
6.  Code ARP table LRU algorithm to evict slots when the table is full
7.  [done] figure out what's needed: arp_add_... vs. arp_update_...
8.  [done] Add if ( != NULL) on function pointers before calling
9.  A way trace packet drops
10. IP layer: ICMP (to enable 'ping' application), UDP, and TCP
11. interface_link_state() should call the link state function through a pointer,
    the current implementation calls the enc26j60 function directly
12. add code to interface_link_state() or other function to set link state in the interface
    structure and act by calling a registered callback
13. fragmentation and assembly of IPv4 packets
