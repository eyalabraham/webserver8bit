===========================================================
 This section describes the build environment for 8bit x86
===========================================================

Write this and built the new environment around Eclipse after having many issues
with a build environment based on Borland C IDE

The requirements for this work are
- installed Borland IDE with access to the command line tools bcc.exe tlink.exe ...
- TASM command line for tasm.exe (and optional: h2ash.exe)
- Eclipse IDE
- DosBox for Linux
- the set of scripts in this directory
- Make utility

in DosBox .config define the following mount points

    [autoexec]
    # Lines in this section will be run at startup.
    # You can put your MOUNT lines here.
    mount c ~/drive_c
    mount l ~/Documents

-----------------------------------------------------------
 TASM
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. use this command line example to invoke TASM and save its output to a file:
    dosbox -c "c:\\tasm\\bin\\tasm.exe l:\\webserve\\src\\_lmte.asm l:\\webserve\\bin\\_lmte.obj > l:\\webserve\\bin\\tasm.out" -c exit
2. use awk script to parse output file and generate Eclipse output format for Eclipse event window
3. package #1 and #2 in a shell script
4. use shell script in #3 as the build command in the make file
